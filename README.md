# automated_leaf_segmentation
In order to create a suitable database of plant images, compromising of healthy and diseased images, we need to obtain images of plant leaves in a white background. This task can be difficult and tiring for agriculture workers and researchers, since plant leaves are naturally not available in a whitened background. The availabitity of any smart means of obtaining the segmeent plant leaf with just the touch of a button is a great stride forward in such research areas. Our aim to to impleemmnt exactly that. We are using image processing segmentation algorithms to achieve this task.

We are using some codes available from the opencv library, such as the watershed algorithm and the grabcut algorithm.

We hope to implement the final algorithm running as an android smartphone app, which will be used as our means of obtaining the database for diseased plant leaf image collection.
